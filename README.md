# DWDCWebsite
A small landing page created for a non-profit organization during a web design class. The assignment included two parts,
an interactive website using any tools/templates we wanted, and a social media analysis of the non-profit's Instagram 
highlighting what could be done more successfully. 

A working version of this website can be found at:
